00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:27,240
All right then gang, in this lesson, I want to talk about something called MCP and MCP servers, which can give Clarko the ability to connect and communicate with external data sources, services, and APIs.For example,When I'm working with Claude in this project right now, it knows about my project and it can use all its built-in tools to make changes and run bash commands and whatnot.But those tools only extend to the scope of this codebase, right?

2
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:55,280
And there's no tools for Claude code to interact with external data sources, third-party services, or APIs.I can't tell it, for example, to reach out to a database to analyze my tables or even create a new one for me because it doesn't have the tools to do that, but that's where MCP servers come into play.So just very briefly, MCP stands for Model Context Protocol.It was designed by Anthropic, who made Claude Code, and it defines a way that AI models can interact with external sources.

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:21,440
And we do this by providing them with additional tools and context through MCP servers.And different MCP servers come with different tools to do different things and interact with different sources.So you can think of an MCP server as something you can essentially plug into Claude Code or whatever client you're using, and then ClaudeClaude, directed by the AI model, can use whatever tools the server provides to interact with some external data source.

4
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:48,680
For example, the Supabase MCP server contains tools to do things like list tables, deploy edge functions, and even execute SQL commands.So if I installed the Supabase MCP server, Claude would have access to all those tools, and I could say to Claude code,read the blogs table in Supabase, make an interface to model the records.And in response, Claude would check for any tools it can use to do this, and it would find one in this Supabase MCP server.

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:02:11,120
It would then use that tool, which is just a function defined within the server, to reach out to the database and find the blogs table.It would read it and then return the format of that table to Claude Code, and then using that data, Claude Code could decide how to make the interface.So when we use MCP servers, it's not the AI itself or the client like Claudecode that reaches out directly to these external sources.

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:40,160
It's the MCP server that does that, and then it provides Claude code or whatever client you might be using with the ability to call and use those tools.Another MCP server called Playwright provides AI models with the tools to open a browser, navigate through web pages, inspect elements, take screenshots.The Context7 MCP server provides tools to get up-to-date documentation from a lot of frameworks and libraries, which you can then ask Claude Code to use when implementing new features using those frameworks or libraries.

7
00:02:40,600 --> 00:03:07,120
And there's loads more too, which you can find on websites like this one, pulsemcp.com.So definitely check that out.We're going to install these two servers right here, Context7 and Playwright.And over the next couple of lessons, we're going to put them to use in our workflow.First though, how do we actually add the servers?Well, if we take a look at the Claude code docs on the MCP installation section, you can see that we can add them locally on our computer or by connecting to them remotely.

8
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:27,560
Now, we'll be adding the servers locally, so we'll be using this option at the top.And the way we do this is by using the command Claude MCP add and then whatever the server name is, then the command and any arguments.Also, if you're on Windows, then you're currently, you'll need to add one more thing, which if we scroll down here, you're going to see it in a big yellow warning box, and that is to

9
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:57,360
To add cmd and then forward slash c, so the cmd part opens the Windows command line to run the command, the forward slash c part makes sure the shell gets closed after it's been run.Now, normally, when we use an MCP server, the server docs gives us the whole string to copy and paste in a terminal, which is then going to add the server.But just be aware that you might need to add the cmd forward slash CPAR if you're on Windows for servers that use NPX.Otherwise, it might not work correctly.

10
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:26,560
Anyway, let's head back to the Context 7 MCP page.And we're going to see what it says there about the installation.So if we click on this MCP link up at the top, it should take us to the GitHub page for the server, which it does.And then if you scroll right down, we should eventually see a bunch of options for adding the server to different clients.One of those options should be Claude code.So click on that to expand it, and we're going to get a few different options.The first two are for remote server connections.

11
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:52,240
The one at the bottom is for a local connection.So we say Claude MCP add, then the server name, which is context 7, then we have this double dash, then the npx command.So we're going to copy this now and paste it into the terminal, and then we're also going to make a few edits.So then I've pasted this into my terminal already, and I'm just going to add another few things in.The first thing we'll do is we're going to add another flag to this, just before the double dash, and that is the scope flag.

12
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:15,600
So when we add MCP servers with Claude code, we can add them to three different scopes.Project scope, where the MCP setup gets pushed to remote and everyone working on the project can use the MCPs added to the project.Local scope, which is where only you can use the MCP server on this particular project, and global scope, which is when the MCPsis added globally to Claude code and you can use it for any project on your computer.

13
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:38,560
Now the default scope is local, but I want to make it a project scope so that we can see the MCP configuration here in the project directory.And mostly I use either project or global scope.I very rarely use local scope.Anyway, to add this scope, we use the scope flag followed by project to specify project scope.And again, this could also be local or global.

14
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:59,360
Now before we go any further, I will say this, if you're running Claude code natively on Windows, it can be a little bit buggy when you're adding MCP servers, at least at the time of recording this video.If you're on a Mac, then you probably won't have to jump through any hoops or workarounds and you can just hit enter right now and this would work.If you're on Windows though, you have to do a few more things for it to work properly.

15
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:27,520
First, we have to add the cmd and then forward slash cbit just before the rest of this npx command like we talked about earlier.Secondly, if weWe run this right now, we're going to get an error, which I'll show you by hitting enter, and that error says there's an unknown option Y, which comes right after the npx bit.Now, the Y flag is for auto-accepting defaults to prompts when some package is installed, and it needs to be there in this case.So, how do we get around this?

16
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:56,720
Well, one solution is to run the whole thing without the Y flag first, which we'll do now.And when we do that, it's gonna work, and Claude code makes this .mcp.json file in the root of the project.Now, if we take a look at that, we'll see this JSON object with an MCP service property inside, and it's within this property that all project level servers get added.So we can see this context seven one right here that we just added, and inside that, the server's configured with these different properties.

17
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:27,000
The type is standard in out since this is a local MCP connection that we added.The command is CMD and that's because on Windows we added that extra CMD part.Then we have some arguments including the forward slash C bit, which we also added because we're on Windows.Now again, if you're on a Mac, this will probably look a little bit different and you won't need to make any changes.But on Windows, because we removed that hyphen Y flag, we should now manually add this in to the arguments array after the NPX one.So let's do that

18
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,560
now and then save the file.

19
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:55,920
Right then, so hopefully now that's all going to work when we start up Claude Code, but I do think this whole workaround when using Windows is a little bit clunky and I'm hoping that it's something that can be made simpler in the future and maybe when you're watching this video it will be.Anyway, now let's try using this.Now, when I've just tried using this MCP server, I got some kind of connection error.It failed.It didn't work for whatever reason.So I'm actually going to use the remote server from context 7.

20
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:23,600
It's strange because when I tried this out before recording, it did work.Everything was fine.But this is the problem sometimes because Claude code is new, MCP servers are new, they're changing a lot.Sometimes things can just not work and it might take a little while for things to level out.So what I'm going to do now is go back to the docs and look for the other command I needrun for a remote server.So we're going to go ahead with this one right here which uses HTTP as the transport system.So let's copy this.

21
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:46,680
Alright so I've pasted that into my terminal but I'm going to add one more thing and that is the scope flag after the server name.So after context 7 do double dash then scope and then project to add this at a project level.Press enter.Hopefully now it's going to add that server for us and if we close this terminal and take a look over here we should see the mcp.json file and yet we see that contextseven property inside.

22
00:08:46,680 --> 00:09:15,760
This time the type is HTTP because we're using a remote connection and this is the URL for the server as well.Cool.So now we need to start Claude backup, which I'm going to do over here by tapping Claude and then press enter.Let's get rid of the file tree.And then inside here I'm going to say forward slash MCP and this time hopefully we will see the context seven.Okay, it failed to connect.What I'm going to do is press enter andAnd then I'm going to reconnect to this to see if it does connect this time.

23
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:44,800
Okay, looks like it's worked.So forward slash MCP.Now we can see a green tick next to that.We're connected to context 7 and we can start using it.So let me escape out of that.Okay, so now I'm going to get Claude Co to use Context Seven by typing in this prompt, and it says, Can you check the latest Tailwind docs to see if the theme variables are correctly configured in the global CSS file?Use Context Seven.I'm also going to reference that CSS file so it knows where to look, so that's source app and then globals.

24
00:09:45,400 --> 00:10:09,760
dot CSS.And then I'm going to press enter.But before I do that, notice I said use context seven.That's so it explicitly knows to use that MCP server to get the up-to-date information.So let me press enter to do this.And now it wants to use this resolve library ID tool from context seven.And then it wants to use an additional tool and it wants my permission to do this.So I'm going to press yes right here.

25
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:34,480
And now you can see right here, it says, looking at your Tailwind CSS configuration, your theme variables are correctly configured, blah, blah, blah.It's properly structured.Okay, so everything is as it should be.Awesome.So one thing I like to do with Context 7 is tell Claude Code to use it whenever it needs to implement some feature using a third-party framework or library because a lot of the time it can use legacy code.

26
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:52,360
So I want to make sure that it uses the up-to-date documentation every time that it creates some code using those frameworks.And that's not just Claude Code, by the way, that's any AI tool or model.They can all use legacy code because they're trained on that legacy code.So what I'm going to do is add a memory using the hash over here.So I've

27
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:13,360
Press hash, we're going to add a memory, and then I'm going to paste in this memory that says, Use context 7 to check up-to-date docs when needed for implementing new libraries or frameworks or adding features using them.So, if I press enter, we're going to add that to the project memory, and if we then open this file up, we should see that at the bottom now.Yep, there it is.Awesome.

28
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:38,320
Okay then, so now we're going to add another server called Playwright, which provides Claude code with the tools to do things like open a browser, click on links, take screenshots, etc.So I'm on the Playwright MCP page right here, and for Claude code it says run this command, which because we're on Windows, we're going to have to tweak again.I also want to make sure we're using project scope when we add it.So copy this command, then head back to your terminal.

29
00:11:38,560 --> 00:12:03,200
So then I've already added this command in, as well as two other things, the scope flag first of all over here.to say we want to add this at project level and then also the CMD forward slash C part because we're running this on Windows.This time we don't need to add the Y flag for this particular server.Alright so now let's hit enter.Hopefully that's going to add the playwright server to the mcp.json file.

30
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:28,400
So let's take a look at that over here and yet we can see we've got the context 7 one now and also the playwright one and this time the type is standard in out the command CMD then the argumentsdown here.Awesome.So then, now we need to start Claude back up again so that we can try using this.Okay, so I've started Claude up and the first thing I'm going to do is use the MCP tool to make sure that they're connected correctly.Yep, okay, cool.

31
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:57,120
And now I'm going to escape and I'm just going to ask Claude code to maybe open a browser and navigate to netninja.dev and give me a summaryof the site.So this is just to show you that it can navigate to a site using Playwright or Playwright can on its behalf and provide feedback that we need.So it's going to ask for permission, first of all.So we'll say yes.

32
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:06,720
And then on my other screen, it's opened up netninja.dev, which we can see right here.So it's just going to do its browsing.I'm going to take that back off screen.

33
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:37,720
All right, so now it's come back with a little bit of information.It says NetNinja is a comprehensive coding education platform created by Sean, focused on web development training.The site positions itself as a coding dojo where aspiring developers become coding ninjas.So I'm quite pleased with that.It gives us this other information about it as well, which is quite extensive, to be honest.But Playwright can do more than just this.And what I'd like to do is use Playwright to give us feedback on the UX of components that we

34
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:50,320
make when it's used them in the browser.So in the next lesson, what we're going to be doing is making our own sub-agent with Claude code, and we're going to be using the Playwright MCP from within that sub-agent to do just that.
